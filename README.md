# Bishop-PRML-demos

Python-implemented algorithms from Christopher Bishop's book "Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning". 
Some concepts were also taken from Kevin P. Murphy's "Machine Learning: A Probabilistic Perspective".
These algorithms are grouped by chapters and wrapped around tkinter.

All _main.py_ files mostly contain GUI logic. For exploring ML magic take a look at _model_specific.py_ files.
